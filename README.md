# SoundBlock
SoundBlock was a hardware development designed in the shape of a mask. This mask shaped device could be connected to mobile
phone via bluetooth. Its major features are listed below:
1. It picked up an incoming call on your phone via voice commands.
2. When worn around the head, covering lips, it blocked user voice through a sound blocking foam. This way private conversations 
    could be kept private.
